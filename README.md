Airplane Parking Assistant for Manchester Airport

Problem
As an airplane parking assistant,
So that I can efficiently manage parking slots,
I want to be recommended a parking slot when a new airplane arrives.
And to be able to book the plane into that parking slot.
Notes
•	A plane may be parked for a few hours or a few days.
•	There are 100 slots, but they are not of the same size,
o	25 for Jumbos (A380, B747)
o	50 for Jets (A330, B777)
o	25 for Props (E195)
•	Only the plane types listed above will arrive at the airport
•	Smaller planes can park in larger slots, but not the other way around.
•	If no slot is available, an obvious alert should be raised.
•	We have yet to select the device or the data storage mechanism that will be used.
•	Consider how airlines might pre-book slots in a future iteration of this product.
